student name and email are trivial, student first + last name could replace email in the dependencies but would not work in a system if someone has the same name.
email determines check_in_time, academic_rank, residential_status, and slp name
email and a specific check_in_time determine check_out_time, location, purpose, purpose_achieved, tutoring, and comments.

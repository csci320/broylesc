I believe visit2NF is in 3NF. There are no transitive dependencies.

Student also satisfys 3NF with no transitive dependencies.

Sport is not 3NF because of its complex relations.

Major is 3NF for sure, it has only the one column.

Student_sport does not fit 3NF because of the gender sport relationship.

student_major does fit 3nf because it is a direct relationship between the student and a major.

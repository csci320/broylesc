I believe visit2NF is BCNF compliant. All determinates are canidate keys.

Student does not satisfy BCNF with the slp_instructor.

Sport is not 3NF because of its complex relations therefor its not BCNF.

Major is BCNF, it has only the one column.

Student_sport does not fit 3NF because of the gender sport relationship and not BCNF

student_major does fit 3nf because it is a direct relationship between the student and a major.

computer and printer are both BCNF compliant as they were created to be.

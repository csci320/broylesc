Referential Integrity I find is far more enforced in MySQL than MongoDB. MySQL's tables are far easier to track and with enforcement features in MySQL
references require more attention. MongoDB seems to be more user friendly as it's syntax is very much object oriented. However I found it more difficult
to track and trouble shoot errors in the massive chunks of object code.
